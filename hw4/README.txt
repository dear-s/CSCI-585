Q1 - 
MEDV = (-0.1084)*CRIM + 0.0458*ZN + 2.7187*CHAS=1 + (-17.376)*NOX + 3.8016*RM + (-1.4927)*DIS + 0.2996*RAD + (-0.0118)*TAX + (-0.9465)*PTRATIO + 0.0093*B + (-0.5226)*LSTAT + 36.3411

>> This is an example of multiple linear regression.
[assesses the relationship between a dependent variable (class) and multiple independent variables.]

>> MEDV/class: dependent (predicted) variable
>> 36.3411: y-intercept (value of class when all other independent variables are 0)
>> CRIM, ZN, CHAS=1, NOX, RM, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT: independent variable

>> regression coefficients: represents the change in the value of MEDV relative to a one-unit change in them

>> Sign of a regression coefficient tells whether there is a positive or negative correlation between each independent and the dependent variable. Positive coefficient indicates if the value of the independent variable increases, the mean of the dependent variable also increases. A negative coefficient tells us that if the independent variable increases, the dependent variable will also decrease.

Why 2 features [INDUS and AGE] are not included?

They are removed because they have the lowest standardized regression coefficient. 
They are not contributing to explain the variance in MEDV.

Adding independent variables to a multiple linear regression model will always increase the amount of explained variance in the dependent variable (typically expressed as RÂ²).  Therefore, adding too many independent variables without any theoretical justification may result in an over-fit model.

So, to avoid overfitting, M5 selection algorithm has eliminated these variables.
